# Boz Libre Hosting Panel

This projects was started to create another __keep it simple and stupid__ libre web hosting control panel suitable for providers of everyday shared hosting services.

Features that will be supported:

* administration of own FTP accounts (thanks to Pure-FTPd over MariaDB)
* administration of own mailboxes and aliases (thanks to Postfix and Dovecot over MariaDB)
* administration of own MariaDB databases
